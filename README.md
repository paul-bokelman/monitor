### Radio Monitoring System

This project aims to reduce latency between live audio issues and their detection while also providing feedback on potential causes. The goal is to increase the speed at which issues are identified and resolved. Additionally, the project will be implemented in phases to incrementally achieve various levels of functionality.

### Phase 1: Notification

Notify engineers when something sounds funky.

Requirements:

- Take input from LiveWire
- Group and distinguish signals
- Compare and analyze signals for anomalies or abnormalities
- Notify engineers by email or other service Pushover
- Onsite or cloud integration â€” ensure service is always live

### Phase 2: Assistive

Implements notification phase but also provides educated information on what may be causing the issue.

Requirements: TBD
